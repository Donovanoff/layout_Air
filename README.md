# Air landing page
In this project, I developed a landing page based on a Figma design, implementing HTML and SCSS while adhering to the BEM methodology.
By incorporating CSS Grid, I ensured the responsiveness of the layout across various screen sizes.
This approach facilitated efficient styling and maintenance, resulting in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Large screens 2560px
The design 1600px
Desktop 1280px
Small desktop 1024px
Tablet 640px
Mobile (> 320px)
